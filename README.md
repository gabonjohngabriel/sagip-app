This study aimed to develop and test an IoT-based healthcare assistant technology prototype to address issues such as inefficient operational efficiency and resource allocation in Philippine healthcare facilities. The study utilized a mixed-method explanatory sequential design, combining quantitative surveys using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), along with qualitative interviews to assess perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, advantages, disadvantages, and the overall acceptability of the prototype. The results showed a significant difference in perceived ease of use, where IT professionals find it easier to operate than medical professionals. Conversely, both groups equally perceived that the healthcare assistant technology as useful, as shown in its perceived usefulness. Moreover, the study also identified key perceptions of healthcare assistant technology, emphasizing benefits such as real-time hospital navigation, and convenient access to services. However, it has also suggested barriers like digital literacy gaps, financial constraints, and resistance to change hinder equitable adoption. Additionally, integrating hospital systems into a universal application was deemed necessary for the interoperability of patientsâ€™ information from one institution to another.
